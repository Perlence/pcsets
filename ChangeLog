ChangeLog: pcsets version 2 series                            -*-Text-*-
========================================================================

  PCSETS VERSION 2.0.2

  My apologies for the lag in updating this module. I'm a middle school
  science teacher by day, a musician by night, and ... well, evidently
  a programmer in the only thing left -- The Twilight Zone(tm). School
  started up again, and I'm in a constant battle to get things done.

  First, I had to fix the versioning information in the README file.
  The one that was published in the beta versions -- and all the way
  up to version 2.0.1 -- was, I guess you could say, a missed merge.
  All this time, I thought the text read correctly.  I focused on the
  'big picture' items at the top of the file, and sort of assumed I'd
  merged that change from the now-extinct 'Monolith' branch. [One with
  pcops integrated into PcSets... bad idea for various reasons, so it
  went to visit the Triceratops early on.]

  Next, I started a tutorial.  Right now, it's only up to Chapter 2.
  However, the finished product will have an index, references, and
  some handy diagrams.

  Finally, I upgraded pcsets.tonerow with a new function and a new
  method:

    pcsets
    `-- tonerow
        |-- ToneRow
        |   `-- contour
        `-- randomrow

  I put in a decent amount of documentation for these additions; have
  a look at the module with pydoc and it should provide a sort of
  introduction. Until I get to that section of the tutorial, that is
  ;-)

  PCSETS VERSION 2.0.1

  Presenting the new module, pcsets.tonerow, which implements 12-tone
  rows and the standard group operations on them (P, R, I, and RI).
  This is an *experimental* module, and won't be in final form until
  at least version 2.1; I need to add a lot of features, such as a
  generator function (in the form f(pcs) -> ToneRow).

  In the meantime, the module is heavily populated with documentation
  strings; a run through it with pydoc might be a good introduction.

  PCSETS VERSION 2.0.0 OFFICIAL RELEASE


  pcsets/*.py: Docstrings were updated to reflect current status; they
  were also reformatted, if necessary, to look better with pydoc.

  pcsets.catalog: Somehow this got by with only rudimentary
  docstrings. I added them. Actually, I added a lot -- the module doc
  is about the size of a mini tutorial. What can I say, the subject
  fascinates me.

  pcsets.catalog: Changed the names of methods rewrite, rebuild, and
  retrieve to the same names with an underscore '_' preface. These are
  more like internal functions.

  ./runtest.py: Added a notice that only shows up for the 'catalog'
  tests -- "Generating prime set catalog... (this may take a
  moment)" The same message was inserted at the start of the
  pcsets.catalog.showcatalog() demo function.

  pcsets.pcops.OpSet: now returns the string 'None' when __str__
  output is requested, but no solution sets were found.

  PCSETS VERSION 2.0.0 BETA 3 RELEASE


  Additions to Core API (see full list in the previous ChangeLog entry)

  pcsets/
  |-- pcset
  |   `-- PcSets
  |       `-- reduced +    # These additions are
  `-- pcops                # all shortcut functions
      |-- rel_Tn +         # for otherwise 'wordy'
      `-- rel_TnI +        # operation sequences.


  1. Two new test types were added to test/test_noteops, both having to
     do with scales. The 'minimum conflict' setting should be expected
     to reproduce the common 'spellings' of all the possible major
     scales from B major to Db major. The only expected error would
     be the enharmonic F# and Gb scales, which would require Cb or E#
     (illegal, since in pcsets, natural notes are always natural notes).

     Also, it is expected that common alternative scales such as
     the melodic minor and harmonic minor -- which can be represented
     by an example scale with a single accidental -- should be able
     to reproduce that form.  For example, the harmonic minor is often
     given as a modification of the A minor scale to "A B C D E F G#"

  2. By default, pcsets.pcops.OpSet is not a *-exported class. Instead,
     four functions in pcsets.pcops return their solution sets as
     OpSet instances. However, in playing around with the system in
     interactive mode, it was found a __str__ function was VERY helpful
     for quick analysis:

       >>> from pcsets.pcset import *
       >>> from pcsets.pcops import *
       >>> pcs = PcSet('015')
       >>> cscale = PcSet('024579B')
       >>> print fit_in(cscale,pcs)   # no need to catch the object
       T(4) T(11) TnI(0) TnI(5)
       >>> print pcs.T(4)             # should be a subset of cscale
       459

     Two new tests were added to test/test_pcops to ensure this ability
     doesn't break if changes are made to the package internals.
